### Pass-Enrollment Integration
- [x] **2.3** Design pass-enrollment relationship
  - [x] Determine if Enrollment needs PassId reference
  - [x] Define enrollment expiry when pass expires
  - [x] Handle multiple passes for same schedule scenario
- [x] **2.4** Define enrollment lifecycle events
  - [x] Enrollment creation on pass purchase
  - [x] Enrollment deactivation on pass expiry
  - [x] Enrollment extension on new pass purchase

  - [x] Implement enrollment reactivation logic

### Service Layer Changes
- [x] **3.3** Update PassService enrollment creation
  - [x] Modify pass purchase to create single enrollments
  - [x] Add enrollment validation before creation
  - [x] Handle enrollment lifecycle management
- [x] **3.4** Update ClassAttendanceService
  - [x] Modify enrollment queries to ensure distinct students
  - [x] Update attendance endpoint logic
  - [x] Optimize queries for single enrollment model

### Controller Layer Changes
- [x] **3.5** Fix AttendanceController query logic
  - [x] Update `GetClassSchedule` method
  - [x] Ensure distinct students in response
  - [x] Add proper error handling for enrollment issues
- [x] **3.6** Update related endpoints
  - [x] Review PassController for enrollment impacts
  - [x] Check SchedulesController for enrollment dependencies
  - [x] Update any capacity management logic

## Phase 4: Data Migration
### Migration Planning
- [ ] **4.1** Analyze existing enrollment data
  - [ ] Count duplicate enrollments in database
  - [ ] Identify patterns in current duplicates
  - [ ] Plan consolidation strategy
- [ ] **4.2** Create migration script
  - [ ] Design logic to keep most recent enrollment per student-schedule
  - [ ] Preserve attendance history integrity
  - [ ] Handle foreign key relationships

### Migration Execution
- [ ] **4.3** Backup database
  - [ ] Create full database backup
  - [ ] Verify backup integrity
  - [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] **4.4** Execute consolidation migration
  - [ ] Run migration script
  - [ ] Validate data integrity after migration
  - [ ] Verify attendance history preserved

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation
### Unit Testing
- [x] **5.1** Test enrollment business logic
  - [x] Test single enrollment creation
  - [x] Test duplicate prevention validation
  - [x] Test enrollment lifecycle management
- [x] **5.2** Test repository methods
  - [x] Test new enrollment repository methods
  - [x] Test duplicate checking logic
  - [x] Test enrollment reactivation scenarios

### Integration Testing
- [x] **5.3** Test pass purchase flow
  - [x] Verify single enrollment creation per schedule
  - [x] Test enrollment validation during purchase
  - [x] Test pass expiry enrollment deactivation
- [x] **5.4** Test attendance operations
