### Database Schema
**Successfully migrated data:**
- **1 Location** (SalsaMe Dance Studio)
- **2 Rooms** (Studio A & Studio B with equipment)
- **29 Dance Classes** (Salsa, Bachata, Zouk, Kizomba)
- **32 Class Schedules** (Weekly recurring patterns)
- **10 Students** (Complete profiles with contact info)
- **9 Student Passes** (Monthly/Annual with remaining classes)
- **23 Student Enrollments** (Active class enrollments)

### Technical Details
- **Entity Framework Core 9** with SQLite provider
- **Async/await patterns** throughout data access layer
- **Repository pattern** with interface segregation
- **Comprehensive relationships** between all entities
- **Automatic data seeding** on first application startup

- **Proper indexing** for performance optimization

### API Endpoints
**Currently Working:**
- `GET /api/locations` - Returns studio locations
- `GET /api/classes` - Returns dance classes
- `GET /api/schedules` - Returns class schedules

**Next Phase:**
- Student management endpoints
- Enrollment management
- Pass management system
- Authentication endpoints
