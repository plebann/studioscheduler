# Schedule Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
The schedule system is designed to manage dance classes across multiple locations, supporting the current single-location setup while being scalable for future expansion.

## Data Model

### Location Management
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Location {
        +int locationId
        +string name
        +string address
        +string description
        +bool isActive
        +int capacity
        +DateTime openingTime
        +DateTime closingTime
    }

    class Room {
        +int roomId
        +int locationId
        +string name
        +int capacity
        +string description
        +List<Equipment> equipment
    }

    class DanceClass {
        +int classId
        +string name
        +string level
        +string instructor
        +DateTime startTime
        +DateTime endTime
        +string dayOfWeek
        +Date startDate
        +string style
        +string description
        +int roomId
    }
    
    class Schedule {
        +int scheduleId
        +int locationId
        +Date effectiveFrom
        +Date effectiveTo
        +bool isActive
        +List<DanceClass> classes
        +getLocationSchedule()
        +getClassesByRoom()
    }

    Location "1" *-- "many" Room
    Location "1" *-- "many" Schedule
    Schedule "1" *-- "many" DanceClass
    Room "1" -- "many" DanceClass
```
